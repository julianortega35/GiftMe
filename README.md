# GiftMe! üéÅ

## Description

What can you do with all the stuff that you don't use anymore? 

Don't throw them away!

We have the solution for you right here, our APP (name).

With APP (name) you will acces to a huge social web of people like you, where you'll be able to share all the things that you don't need anymore and find some others that maybe you need!

And all for free! 

We want to avoid the idea of single use items promoted in current societies by reinforcing the practice of sharing and helping each other.

With APP(name) we contribute to the 3R's (Reduce, Reuse and Recicle) to make our planet a better place to live üåç 

Be smart! don't throw your stuff! Give them a second life! ‚ôªÔ∏è
